## Description
This codebook contains information on the variables of the tidyHAR dataset. It updates previous information from files of the original UCI HAR Dataset from which tidyHAR was created (check README.md for more information.

## Study
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

## Data collection and processing
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## Understanding the variables

The following variables were then created, where the first letter stands for 'time' (t) or 'frequency' (f):

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Those who had three-dimensional spatial values were further decomposed in the X, Y and Z directions, as in the following example:
tBodyAcc-X
tBodyAcc-Y
tBodyAcc-Z

The original dataset had, for each of these variables, a set of relevant descriptive features such as maximum value, signal entropy and skewness of the frequency domain signal. tidyHAR only kept the mean (mean() and standard deviation (std()), as in:
tBodyAcc-mean()-X
tBodyAcc-std()-X

This is the final list of the 66 numerical variables included:
tBodyAcc-mean()-X
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z

Two other columns were added: subject, which identifies the human subect performing the activity by using a number from 1 to 30; and activity, a factor column with six levels as self-describing labels for the activity being performed by the subject: laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking_downstairs and walking_upstairs.
